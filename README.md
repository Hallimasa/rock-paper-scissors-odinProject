# **Rock Paper Scissors**

This game was made for completing [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) curriculum, you can play the game here [LIVE PAGE](https://hallimasa.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-odinProject/)

## What I learn doing this project?

- Learn more about what is an **Array** and why only accepts number for indexes, and if you use strings as indexes they will be converted to an **Object**, and methods that work with **Arrays** will no longer work anymore. That's why I made a section inside of the code thats convert **undefined** values to **0**, because otherwise the 0 results will be show by **undefined**.
